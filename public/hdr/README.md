# HDRI Environment Maps

This directory contains HDR environment maps for realistic lighting in the photography studio.

## Adding HDR Files

Place `.hdr` files in this directory to use them with the HDRI environment system.

### Sample HDR File

To get started, you need to add an HDR file. Here are some free sources:

- **Poly Haven (polyhaven.com)**: Free high-quality HDRIs
- Download `studio_small_08_1k.hdr` or similar studio HDRI
- Place the file in this directory

### Recommended Settings

- Resolution: 1K-2K (balance between quality and performance)
- Format: `.hdr` (Radiance HDR format)
- Type: Studio lighting, outdoor environments, or indoor spaces

## Usage

1. Place your `.hdr` file in this directory
2. Open the Aro application
3. Click "HDRI Environments" button
4. Select your HDRI from the list
5. Optionally check "Show HDRI as visible background"

The HDRI will provide realistic lighting and reflections for your 3D models.
